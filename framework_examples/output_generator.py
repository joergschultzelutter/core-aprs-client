    Parameters
    ==========
    data_parameters: dict
        dictionary object, containing data from input_parser.py
        as received by this module's generate_output_message function.

    Returns
    =======

    This is a stub for your custom APRS output generator

    Parameters
    ==========
    input_parser_response_object: dict | object
        dictionary object, containing data from input_parser.py
        Literally speaking, you will use the content from this
        dictionary in order to generate an APRS output message.
        You can (and should!) customize this dict object but ensure that
        both input_parser and output_processor use the same structure
        Note that you can also return other objects such as classes. Just ensure that
        both input_parser and output_generator share the very same
        structure for this variable.

    Returns
    =======
    success: bool
        True if everything is fine, False otherwise.
        Unlike for the input processor, there are no edge cases that we need to take
        care of (e.g. ignoring incoming messages). Therefore, a simple true/false
        return code will suffice.
    output_message: str
