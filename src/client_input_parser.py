def parse_input_message(aprs_message: str, from_callsign: str):
    """
    This is a stub for your custom APRS input parser.

    Parameters
    ==========
    aprs_message: str
        The APRS message that the user has provided us with (1..67
        bytes in length). Parse the content and figure out what
        the user wants you to do.
    from_callsign: str
        Ham radio callsign that sent the message to us.
        Might be required by the input processor e.g. in case you
        have to determine the from_callsign's latitude/longitude.

    Returns
    =======
    success: bool
        True if everything is fine, False otherwise.
    input_parser_error_message: str
        if success==False, this field can contain an optional
        error message (e.g. context-specific errors related to the
        keyword that was sent to the bot). If this field is empty AND
        success=False, then the default error message will be returned.
    input_parser_response_object: dict
        Dictionary object where we store the data that is required
        by the 'output_generator' module for generating the APRS message.
        For this stub, that dictionary is empty.
    """

    # Let's build a very simple command line parser. Our parser will support
    # two commands:
    # Command #1 - "greetings" keyword
    #              Builds a string "Greetings " + callsign, then returns that
    #              string back to the APRS user
    #              Internal command code = "greetme"
    # Command #2 - "hello" keyword
    #              Sends a "Hello World" string to the user
    #              Internal command code = "sayhello"
    # Command #3 - "lorem" keyword
    #              Sends a really long "lorem ipsum" string to the user
    #              Internal command code = "loremipsum"
    # Command #4 - "error" keyword
    #              Simulates an error (e.g. missing keyword parameter)
    #              Internal command code = "sayhello"
    #
    # Due to simplicity reasons, the demo parser uses very crude code. For a
    # production release, you rather might want to use e.g. regular expressions
    # for keyword parsing
    #
    # The internal command code will tell the output processor what to do. For mere
    # illustration purposes, this code stub's internal command codes differ from
    # the user's input (via the APRS message)

    # Initially assume that the user has sent us no valid keyword
    # This will trigger the output parser's error handler, thus allowing it
    # to send usage instructions to the user

    # user expects from us. Per default, that variable is empty
    command_code = ""

    # The following variable is used in conjunction with errors during parsing.
    # Assuming that e.g. your keyword is used for pulling a wx report for a certain
    # city but the user forgot to specify that additional parameter, you can use this
    # variable. By populating it, core-aprs-client will output THIS variable's content
    # to the user whenever 'success == False' applies. If that variable is empty, the
    # bot's default error message will be used instead.
    # You can easily build your own error handling mechanisms in case this function
    # does not work for you
