    This is a stub for your custom APRS output generator

    Parameters
    ==========
    response_parameters: 'dict'
        dictionary object, containing data from input_parser.py
        Literally speaking, you will use the content from this
        dictionary in order to generate an APRS output message.
        For this stub, that dictionary is empty.

    Returns
    =======
    success: 'bool'
        True if everything is fine, False otherwise.
    output_message: 'list'
        List object, containing 0..n APRS output messages
        of up to 67 characters in length.
