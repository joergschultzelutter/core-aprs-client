# Program Configuration File

When it comes to the user's individual configuration settings, `core-aprs-client` solely relies on an external config file. Its default file name is `core-aprs-client.cfg` and can be overwritten by specifying an individual file name program parameter during program start.

`core-aprs-client.cfg` is divided into multiple sections whose contents will be described in the following help pages. Each documentation page contains the associated configuration variables along with their data types (`str`, `int`, `float`, and `boolean`). Note that `boolean` value settings in the configuration file are case-insensitive and provide support for custom key values:

| Setting in config file  | Python `bool` equivalent |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| `true`, `yes`, or `on`  | `True`                   |
| `false`, `no`, or `off` | `False`                  |

> [!NOTE]
> Except for the first two configuration sections, all other configuration sections are _optional_ and have been pre-configured. If you are happy with the default settings, modify those parts of the config file which _do_ require modifications (e.g. call sign, passcode) â€” and you're good to go.

> [!TIP]
> Complete sample file templates for both the configuration file and the Apprise configuration file can be found in the `sample_aprs_client` directory.

## Mandatory configuration file sections

| Configuration Section                                         | Usage                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [client_config](configuration_subsections/config_client.md)   | Basic APRS call sign & filter configuration.                                    |
| [network_config](configuration_subsections/config_network.md) | APRS-IS networking settings, such as server, port, passcode, and APRS-IS filter |

## Optional configuration file sections

> [!Tip]
> These configuration file sections have been preconfigured. You can use the file's default settings unless you want to use a very specific configuration for your program's purposes.

# Notes:
# - The variable name used in this section will be used for broadcasting, meaning that if you create a variable `blnhello`, the `core-aprs-client` will broadcast a bulletin `BLNHELLO` along with its associated message to the APRS users.
# - The variable name always gets converted to uppercase characters; there is no need for you to use uppercase values in the configuration file.
# - All bulletin messages' variable names MUST start with the `BLN` prefix.
# - Following that fixed prefix, a combination of 6 more digits or ASCII-7 characters are permissable (0..9, A..Z)
# - Duplicate key entries (e.g. `bln0` occurs more than once) will cause a program error.
# - Message content longer than 67 characters will get truncated
# - Bullets use ASCII-7 character set only
# - Entries with no message content will be ignored and not broadcasted to APRS-IS
