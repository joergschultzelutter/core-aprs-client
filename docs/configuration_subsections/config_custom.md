# Custom Configuration

> [!TIP]
> Custom content. You can add your very own configuration here - `core-aprs-client` will make that data available to you via the `program-config` object. Access your custon configuration via `program_config["custom_config"]["your_custom_configuration_setting"]`.

The respective section from `core-aprs-client`'s config file lists as follows:

```
[custom_config]
#
# This section is deliberately kept empty and can be used for storing your
# individual APRS bot's configuration settings
```
